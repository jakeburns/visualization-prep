<h1>Data Visualizations: Good vs Bad</h1>
<div align = "center" class="intro">
A great visualization is one that conveys information in an insightful effective way. One of the most important parts of the way this information is conveyed is that it is accurate. Yes, design matters to a certain degree, but design means nothing if the information conveyed is inaccurate or doesn't make sense.

  The picture above is an example of a "great" visualization. It shows a chart of different brands of batteries which were tested in identical flashlights and the hours they lasted. Not only is the information portrayed in a pleasing easy to understand manner, it gets straight to the point using only the words and pictures necessary to get the point across. It excels on design, whereas what would normally be a bar graph of a solid color is the battery of the brand it's representing. This makes the visualization even easier to read.
